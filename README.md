Overview

Pneumonia is a serious infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Features

- Upload chest X-ray images and get a prediction on whether the image indicates Pneumonia or Normal condition
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Trained deep learning model with high accuracy

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pneumonia-detection-from-X-Ray.git
2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application: streamlit run app.py

Usage

1. Upload a chest X-ray image
2. Click the "Predict" button
3. View the prediction result
